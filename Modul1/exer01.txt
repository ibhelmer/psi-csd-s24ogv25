1. Use the ls command from the root (/) directory to explore the directory
structure of Linux. Move to each of the directories with the cd command
and run pwd to verify where you are in the directory structure.

2. Use the whoami command to verify which user you are logged in as.

3. Use the locate command to find wordlists that can be used for password
cracking.

4. Use the cat command to create a new file and then append to that file.
Keep in mind that > redirects input to a file and >> appends to a file.

5. Create a new directory called hackerdirectory and create a new file in
that directory named hackedfile. Now copy that file to your /root directory
and rename it secretfile.
