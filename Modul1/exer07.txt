Let's break down the expressions based on the given list myList = [2, 5, 9, 13, 27, 33].

(a) myList[0]
This will return the first element of the list. Guess: 2

(b) myList[2]
This will return the third element of the list (since list indexing starts at 0). Guess: 9

(c) myList[2:3]
This is list slicing, which will return a sublist starting from index 2 up to (but not including) index 3. Guess: [9]

(d) myList[-1]
Negative indexing starts from the end of the list. -1 refers to the last element. Guess: 33

Let's now test these in Python:

      myList = [2, 5, 9, 13, 27, 33]

print(myList[0])   # Expected output: 2
print(myList[2])   # Expected output: 9
print(myList[2:3]) # Expected output: [9]
print(myList[-1])  # Expected output: 33


Running the above code will confirm the guessed results.
